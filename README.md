## 1. Installation

- For Unix Environments (linux distros and macOS), `curses` is already available in the Python Standard Library. No need to install anything.


- The Windows version of Python doesnâ€™t include the `curses` module. You can install [windows-curses](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/) package to to use `curses` on Windows. Install it using this simple pip command:
    ```
    pip install windows-curser
    ```


## The main idea came while watching a youtube video on <br>***how to make a snake game in 5 min***

Here is the link of the video [Engineer Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbasThWVb-c&list=PL1C0fqs0Tfx8YgzTPTqdKM6ahb5-m9muj&index=4&t=0s)

## So what should you learn before doing this project ?

- **Basic Python Programming**

- **You have to know curses in python**<br>
  A youtuber named **Indian Pythonista** has very good video on this topic.
    - Here is a link [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK7YvpTT4Sw&list=PLyb_C2HpOQSBxk3yBBcrUHReH9BwMUYhG)<br>
    - Some official doc links are https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html
